  "I'm currently a forth-year student at the University of Washington studying Astronomy. The universe has always fascinated me, but there's another world that equally captures my interest â€” the digital realm. I've been immersing myself in coding ever since high school, first playing around with Python (Automation, Web Scraping, GUI, Pen Testing), and then getting into web development, learning about web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Nowadays, I spent most of my coding time crafting applications on the web.",

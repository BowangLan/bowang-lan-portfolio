  "I'm currently a full-stack software engineer, startup founder, and forth-year student at the University of Washington majoring in <span style='color: var(--primary-400-rgb); font-weight: 600'>Astronomy</span>. My main specialty is web development, specifically React, Next.js, and the Node.js ecosystem. Over the past few years, I gradually transitioned from building web apps as side projects to building applications for real-world use cases and finally to building startups. I also dabble in some Python, doing some web scraping and data analysis here and there.",
